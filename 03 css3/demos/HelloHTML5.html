                What is a header</h2>
            <p>
                A group of introductory or navigational aids. A header element typically contains
                the section’s heading (an h1–h6 element or an hgroup element), but can also contain
                other content, such as a table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos.

            <h2>
                What are articles</h2>
            <p>
                The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained
                composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be
                independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum
                post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an
                interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

            <h2>
                What is nav</h2>
            <p>
                The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts
                within the page: a section with navigation links. Not all groups of links on a page
                need to be in a nav element only sections that consist of major navigation blocks
                are appropriate for the nav element. In particular, it is common for footers to
                have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the footer element is more
                appropriate in such cases, and no nav element is necessary for those links.
